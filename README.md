C:
The faults with this elevator interface is rather obvious. Its order of the floors is not user-friendly; even more so, it’s very unfriendly to those are blind or have reduced sight. The order of the floors are not intuitive and make no sense. Rather than being 1,2,3 vertically ascending, they’re positioned in two cell rows ascending. The lowest row being one and two, and then 3 and four for the second row. It makes little sense in terms of a practical interface. This is not useful for those who are visually impaired. As well, there is no audible feedback for users. Meaning, if a blind person were to use this, they would not know whether they will be taken to the right floor. Although there is braille, it can still be tedious considering the order of the buttons. 


B: 
 The typical sequence for using an elevator starts with clicking the up/down arrow outside the elevator. Eventually, the elevator doors will open. Then, the user will see the internal interface of the elevator. This interface includes an order of the floors, a close button, an open button, and buttons for the alarm and emergency. The main functionality the user looks for is simply selecting which floor to go to. However, depending on the interface, this can be made more difficult than it should be. For example, one mistake might be the order of the floors and buttons; similar to the example shown previously. Another mistake might be a lack of feedback, whether it be a light behind the buttons, or a quiet “Ding!”. Simply, a reorder of the buttons and added feedback can greatly improve the experience for the user.

A: 
A touch screen interface with feedback and properly ordered buttons is a good start for a solution. The screen size would be around the size of a typical tablet:
